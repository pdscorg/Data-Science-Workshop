DAY 1

Assignment 1 (NumPy):

Suppose PDSC team made a Nepali Tesla car and  were testing in main road. 
It is on the way to Thapathali from Pulchowk. It is trying to detect number plate which he should follow as per the instruction. 
The number plate image was taken and was converted to array A and preprocessed with NumPy to finally detect the numbers.
Create a random numpy array A with shape (2, 4) and another array B with shape (4, 2). 
Both containing integer values in range 20 to 50.
Compute the dot product between those array represented by C and also find sum of elements for each array.
If sum_of_A is greater or equal to that of sum_of_B, compute transpose of C and if it's false, 
multiply each element of array C by 9.
Display the result.


Assignment 2 (Pandas):
Load the data from link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdscorg/Data/main/Life%20Expectancy%20Data.csv in pandas dataframe.
Check if it contains missing value.
Try, dropping the rows containing missing values.
If you found more than 200 rows being dropped, load the data again and fill the missing values with mean.
Manipulate the dataframe by keeping only the data having Life expectancy above 80.
Take first 5 columns of the dataframe and save it to csv file
(Submit the csv file and the notebook/python file)
